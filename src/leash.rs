//! The Unix leash: a forked watchdog that takes a managed child's whole
//! process group down when this host process dies, however it dies.
//!
//! `Cmd.spawn_leashed!` asks for this. The child is placed in the group the
//! watchdog leads (see [`crate::process_service`]), so three things stop a
//! leashed child from outliving the host: the normal-exit sweep in
//! `process_service::shutdown`, this watchdog on deaths that skip it (Ctrl+C,
//! crashes, `kill -9`), and on Linux also `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`, which needs no
//! second process and fires without the watchdog's EOF latency.
//!
//! Windows needs none of this: a managed child there lives in a Job Object
//! with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, so the OS takes the job down
//! when the host's handle closes, on any death. This module is Unix-only.
